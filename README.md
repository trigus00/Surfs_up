### -- Project Status : Completed 

## Project Intro/Objective 
You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with your trip planning, you need to do some climate analysis on the area. The following outlines what you need to do.

### Methods Used 
* Data Visualization
* Data Gathering 
* Data Cleaning 
* Data Query 

### Technologies Used 
* Pandas
* FLASK 
* SQLAlchemy
* Matplotlib 


## Project Description 
To begin, use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. All of the following analysis should be completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Then plot a percipitation analysis over the last 12 months from when that date is selected. Next what I did is calculated the total number of weather station and query out the one's that are most active out of the data set. Then I design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data from the most active weather station. After the analysis is completed , I design a Flask API based on the queries that you have just developed.



## Needs of this project
